# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was setting up and hooking up the Raspberry Pi and all the necessary components onto my tv. The heatsinks, the sd card, and the controller were all added to ensure that the Raspberry Pi was working. Instead of the Raspberry Pi Os software, I had to first download a different software called Retro Pie. With Retro Pie, I needed to download an Imager for Raspberry Pi. Raspberry Pi Imager automatically downloads a list of the latest versions of Raspbian supported by the Raspberry Pi. Raspbian is the typical Raspberry Pi Os software, the one I needed on the Raspberry Pi was Retro Pi. With the included SD card, I plugged in the SD into my computer and launched the Imager. The imager allowed me to set the Operating System to Retro Pi instead of Raspbian onto the SD card. With the OS imaged onto the SD, I plugged the SD card back into the Raspberry Pi and rebooted the system and Retro Bi booted up.

# Starter Project: TV-B-Gone 


My starter project was the TV-B-Gone, which, upon pressing the button located at the bottom left of the circuit board, will turn off most TVs of American/Asian origin. 

The TV-B-Gone uses 4 LEDs (located at the front of the device) to emit IR pulses and send an IR code to the targeted TV. IR pulses travel at a frequency of 38 KHz, and this is the type of frequency my targeted TV recognizes. If the TV recognizes the IR code, it will turn off. The TV-B-Gone is battery operated, and all its components are soldered onto a PCB. A PCB is known as a printed circuit board and has both conductive and insulating layers. The PCB has two wires that extend from a battery holder soldered into the bottom of the PCB. The batteries supply the power for the device, and the wires allow for the electrical current to reach the PCB. From there, when the button is pressed, a green LED indicator will blink to signal that IR pulses are emitting. The LED indicator light is controlled by the microcontroller, which was inserted into an 8-pin socket. Using resistors, capacitors, oscillators (which produce an oscillating electronic signal), and transistors (a device used to switch or amplify electrical signals), the 4 LEDs at the front of the device are then prompted to emit the IR pulses. 

The main challenge I faced was soldering. Prior to the first day of BSE, I had no experience in soldering. Unsurprisingly, when I initially started, I was progressing at a very slow/inefficient pace, and my soldering work was, to say the least, rough. However, as I progressed, I got better at soldering, and towards the end, I was able to solder at a pretty efficient pace.
